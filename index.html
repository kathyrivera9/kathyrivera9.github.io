              > I am Katherinne Rivera, a recent college graduate in search of new oppportunities to 
              continue my knowledge in the tech world. As we continue to develop, our technology advances with us. There are new discoveries everyday and 
              technology just keeps evolving. As an avid learner, technology fascinates me as there is always something new to learn about it. I have a always 
              been drawn to computers, so wanting a career in the tech world comes naturally to me. Furthermore, due to my love of math, Data Analytics is appealing
              to me as it contains both math and computers. I want to be able to apply my tech skills to data and contribute by solving problems.

                  <h4>My Life</h4>
                  <p>
                    I was born in El Salvador and immigrated to the Unites States when I was almost 2 years. I have lived in Fort Worth, TX my whole life while aspiring and 
                    working towards achieving goals my parents saw as only dreams. As a first generation immigrant, school was not easy as I had to figure out everything by 
                    myself. I didn't have my brothers or parents to tell me how to prepare for college during high school or what to expect in college. Despite having
                    to go through all these experiences by myself, I paved the way for my family in the future by being the first to graduate from a 4-year university.
                    I am glad I'm able to set an example for my younger nieces and nephew. Furthermore, family is important to me and I feel honored to be the one to open doors 
                    for them.

                  <h4>My Education</h4>
                  <p>                    
                    I received my education from the Texas A&M University and earned a Bachelors degree in Applied Math with an emphasis in Computer Science.
                    In addition, I minored in Computer Sciene. During my college experience, I got to learn and love computer science. My first class being an into to
                    JAVA, my interests grew as I was able to see my programming skills grow and produce pretty cool things. This ignited in me the aspiration to start
                    my career in tech so that I may be able to continue learning and watch what I produce become shared by many.
                    
                    I graduated with an Applied Mathematics degree,
            I believe it sets me apart since I have gotten the opportunity to study algorithms in a mathematical point of view. 
            Therefore, I am used to analyzing different problem solving solutions which can be beneficial in programming and 
              software developing
