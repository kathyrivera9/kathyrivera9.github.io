              > I am Katherinne Rivera, a Data Systems Lead at Brighter Bites. During my time at Brighter Bites, my role has evolved from Data Analyst I to Data Analyst II,
              and now to my current role as Data Systems Lead. Throughout this progression, I have had hands-on experience in working in the front-end as well as in the back-end of data. 
              This includes everything from setting up data collection systems, to transforming collected data, then using data to create visual dashboards for reporting. This experience
              has revealed that I enjoy working in the backend more, so I seek to expand on those skills I have learned so far. Additionally, I understand that as we continue to develop,
              our technology advances with us. So I am always open and eager to learn something new. I believe stepping out of my comfort zone is the way to grow and learn. So I'm looking
              for my next challenge.

                  <h4>My Life</h4>
                  <p>
                    Born in El Salvador and being a first generation immigrant, I have always aspired to achieve goals my parents once saw only as dreams. Early on, I learned
                    the value of hard work and perseverance which I still apply in my work today. In data and programming, it's typical to encounter road-blocks, I've discovered 
                    that approaching them with creativity and persistency it's a good way to find a solution. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the challenges, I am proud to be paving the way for my family by being the first to graduate from a 4-year university and setting
                    an example for my younger nieces and nephews.  Family is super important to me and I feel honored to be the one opening doors for the next generation. When my days 
                    aren't spent with my family, you can find me outdoors with my two doggos, Finnley and Flora, exploring new food places with my friends, or exploring a new city.
                    <br><br>
                    I've learned not to wait for the weekend to live life, so I make sure to treat everyday like its a Friday.

                  <h4>My Education</h4>
                  <p>                    
                    My education led me to the Texas A&M University where I earned my Bachelors degree in Applied Math with an emphasis in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Science.
                    During my time in college, I discovered how much I enjoyed computer sciences and coding. My first programming class, an Intro to Java, showed me how a couple lines of
                    code can create ideas into reality, which opened my eyes to the endless possibilities. My Applied Mathematics background, sets me apart since I learned to approach
                    programming not only from a technical perspective, but also through the lens of algorithm and analytical reasoning. I am confident that the programming foundation I 
                    built in college has prepared me to continue learning more programming languages and further expand my technical skills.
                    <br><br>
                    My learning did not stop at college. After graduating, I have taken it upon myself to continue expanding my technical skills by learning new languages such as SQL,
                    and strengthening my understanding of data modeling and database design. On my own, I've taken advantage of the internet resources to learn SQL fundamentals and Data Visualizations
                    through Tableau. At Brighter Bites, I've put these skills to practice where they continued to grow. Additionally, I learned how to use Power BI,
                    data modeling and database design in my role as a Data Analyst. Over time, I built interactive dashboards and visual reports for staff and upper management. 
                    These projects taught me the value of collaboration and how to translate data into insights that have driven real decisions. In my current role as Data Systems Lead,
                    I have become more involved in maintaining, optimizing, and creating our database ETL pipelines ensuring our data systems are efficient, scalable, and reliable.
                    Now, I am currently learning and exploring how to use the different tools meant for Data Ingestion and automation such as Apache airflow, Talend, or Informica.

            <span> I have learned skills in college, with some self-initiative, and through my experience at my current job. I pride myself in being a fast learner and I enjoy learning.
              My skills include SQL and Python as methods of data manipulation and database management, Power BI as methods of creating data visualization and reporting, Power automate 
              and Azure logic apps as methods of automation, and Google Appsheet as methods of data collection. But these are not limited to my skills in Python, C++, and HTML/CSS. 
              Additionally, I have developed my other skills such as data cleaning, data transformations, data integration, presentation skills, data story telling, documentation,
              data modeling, database management, data quality assurance
