              > I am Katherinne Rivera, a Data Systems Lead at Brighter Bites. During my time at Brighter Bites, my role has evolved from Data Analyst I to Data Analyst II,
              and now to my current role as Data Systems Lead. Throughout this progression, I have had hands-on experience in working in the front-end as well as in the backend of data. 
              This includes everything from setting up data collection systems, to transforming collected data, then using data to create visual dashboards for reporting. This experience
              has revelead that I like working in the backend, so I seek to expand on the skills I have learned so far. Additionally, I understand that as we continue to develop,
              our technology advances with us. So I am always open and eager to learn something new. I believe stepping out of my comfort zone is a way to grow and learn. So I'm looking
              for my next challenge.

                  <h4>My Life</h4>
                  <p>
                    Born in El Salvador and being a first generation immigrant, I have always aspired to achieving goals my parents once saw only as dreams. Early on, I learned
                    the value of hard work and perseverance which still drives in my work today. In data and programming, it's typical to encounter road-blocks, and approaching them
                    creativity and persistency is a way I have discovered can get me to a solution. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the challenges, I am proud to be paving the way for my family by becoming the first to graduate from a 4-year university and setting
                    an example for my younger nieces and nephew.  Family is super important to me and I feel honored to be the one opening doors for the next generation. When my days 
                    aren't spent with my family, you can find me outdoors with my two doggos, Finnley and Flora, exploring new food places with my friends, or exploring a new city.
                    <br><br>
                    I've learned not to wait for the weekend to live life, so I make sure to treat everyday like its a Friday.

                  <h4>My Education</h4>
                  <p>                    
                    My education led me to the Texas A&M University where I earned my Bachelors degree in Applied Math with an emphasis in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Science.
                    During my time in college, I discovered how much I enjoyed computer sciences and coding. My first programming class, an Intro to Java, showed me how a couple lines of
                    code can create ideas into reality, which opened my eyes to the endless possibilities. My Applied Mathematics background, sets me apart since I learned to approach
                    programming not only from a technical perspective, but also through the lens of algorithm and analytical reasoning. I am confident in the programming foundation I 
                    built in college to propel my to learning to more programming languages and expand my technical skills.
                    <br><br>
                    My learning did not stop at college. After graduating, I have taken it upon myself to continue expanding my technical skills, learning new languages such as SQL, and
                    and strengthening my understanding of data modeling and database design. On my own, I've take advantage of the internet resources to learn SQL fundamentals and Data Visualizations
                    through Tableau. At Brighter Bites, I've put these skills to practice where they continued to grow. Additionally, I learned how to use Power BI,
                    data modeling and database design as a Data Analyst. Over time, I built interactive dashboards and visual reports for staff and upper management. 
                    These projects taught me the value of collaboration and how to translate data into insights that drive real decisions. In my current role as Data Systems Lead,
                    I have become more involved in maintaining, optimizing, and creating our database ETL pipelines ensuring our data systems are efficient, scalable, and reliable.

            self-initiateive and learned some more. I am a fast learner and I enjoy learning. In college, I learned C++, Java, and a bit of HTML/CSS. After college,
              I dedicated time to learn Python, SQL, and I'm currently learning Tableu. Furthermore these are some certifications I've earned along the way:
