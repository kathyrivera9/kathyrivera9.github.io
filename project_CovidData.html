        This program was created using SQL and Tableau. I used Microsoft SQL Server to write the queries and Tableau public for the visuals. This project was part
        of my learning process in practicing SQL and applying it to Tableau. This project consists of using data collected from 'Our World Data', where the data is
        updated daily (<a href = "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths"> https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths </a>). Then, using SQL to organize the data 
        and to produce visuals that allow for easy analysis of the data.<br>
        <br>
        
        I didn't use all of the data that is provided for quality purposes. My focus was mainly on the way the pandemic spread throughout the world. When writing the 
        queries, I manipulated the data to make tables where I could observe correlations in the numbers while also comparing between countries. Through this, the 
        queries I practiced included organizing columns so I could see the total cases of Covid vs. the new cases of Covid. Also, using the data and providing new
        percentages to forecast the likilhood of death in case of infection. Futhermore, I used the data to create common table expressions (CTE) where more information
        can be gathered. Writing these queries and observing the results not only helped me practice SQL statements, it also showed me how valuable organizing
        large sets of data can be. The queries written can be found in this github repository: 
        <a href = "https://github.com/kathyrivera9/SQL-Covid-Data"> https://github.com/kathyrivera9/SQL-Covid-Data </a> <br>
        <br>
        
        I also used Tableau to help visualize the large amount of data of Covid. I used two different sets of data to create the two dashboards above. The dashboard
        in the middle contained data from 2020 to 2021, this was the original data set that I used to learn how to make visuals in tableau. The dashboard on the far 
        right contains more recent data up until 06/21/2022. I decided to redo the dashboard with more recent data to make it more relevant. However, both dashboards 
        have similar purposes. They show Global numbers, deaths per continent, and even a map to visualize which countries 
        had more infections. This can all be found in the data queries, but seeing pictures is more pleasing to understand the data given.

        And the visualization is more clearly seen in my Tableau:
