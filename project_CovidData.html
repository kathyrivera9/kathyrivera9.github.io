        This program was created using SQL and Tableau. I used Microsoft SQL Server to write the queries and Tableau public for the visuals. This project was part
        of my learning process in practicing SQL and applying it to Tableau. This project consists of using data collected from 'Our World Data', where the data is
        updated daily (<a href = "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths"> https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths </a>). Then, using SQL to organize the data 
        and to produce visuals that allow for easy analysis of the data.<br>
       <br>
        I didn't use all of the data that is provided for quality purposes. My focus was mainly on the way the pandemic spread throughout the world. When writing the 
        queries, I manipulated the data to make tables where I could observe correlations in the numbers while also comparing between countries. Through this, the 
        queries I practiced included organizing columns so I could see the total cases of Covid vs. the new cases of Covid. Also, using the data and providing new
        percentages to forecast the likilhood of death in case of infection. Futhermore, I used the data to create common table expressions (CTE) where more information
        can be gathered from. Writing these queries and observing the results not only helped me practice some SQL statements, it also showed me how valuable organizing
        large sets of data can be. The queries written can be found in this github repository:

        This code can be found on my github.<br>
        
        And the visualization is more clearly seen in Tableau: <br>
