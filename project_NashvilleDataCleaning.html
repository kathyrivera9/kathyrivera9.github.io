        <br>
        This project was written in SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studios. This project's purpose was for me to learn how to use SQL to clean up a data 
        set. I used a Nashville Housing Data where it contained information like sale price, and owner, and owner address, etc. Then after executing a series of 
        queries, the new data was made easier to read and unnecessary information was deleted.<br>
        <br>
        Some methods that were used was 'parsename' to seperate information in a column. Also, the are CTE's included and Join tables. This allowed me to practice 
        statements that I've haven't had a chance to use. I also was able to see them in action and see the results they produce. It makes me more confident to know
        that I can get a dataset and edit it in a way that will be easier to analyze or use later on. It also shows that I know how to make decisions on what
        is necessary and what isn't. <br>
