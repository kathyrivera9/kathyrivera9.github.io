        <b> Python Problems </b> <br>
        <br>
        After graduation college, I set out to learn a new programming language, Python. This is a very popular programming language and also one of the simplest. 
        Taking courses on LinkedIn and watching many youtube videos, I grasped the knowledge of Python. So I set out to put my knowledge into practice through 
        Leetcode problems. I wrote solutions for problems that I have tackled in the past using C++. It was 
        interesting to see how the two languages would vary and how I had to take a different approach. In addition, I got to experience how much simpler it was to 
        write code in python and I regret not learning it sooner.
        <br> 
        There are different sets of challenges that I completed posted in the following list:<br>
